# Humanoid Robot: Servo Motor Control 🤖

## Project Overview 📚
This project demonstrates how to control **6 servo motors** using an **Arduino Uno**. The motors perform two main actions:  
1. **Sweep Movement:** All motors sweep from 0° to 180° for 2 seconds.  
2. **Hold at 90°:** After the sweep, all motors hold at a 90° position.

## Components Used 🛠️
- **Arduino Uno**  
- **6 Servo Motors (SG90 or similar)**  
- **Breadboard**  
- **Jumper Wires**  
- **External 5V Power Supply (Recommended)**
